# Airline-Delay-Prediction
### Overview
 Flight delays are a persistent issue in the aviation industry, affecting millions of passengers and causing significant financial losses for airlines. This project focuses on predicting flight delays using historical flight data and advanced machine learning techniques. By analyzing key factors such as departure times, flight durations, airlines, and routes, the project aims to provide actionable insights for airlines, airports, and passengers.

### Key Objectives
 Predict Delays: Develop machine learning models to classify flights as delayed or not delayed.
 Improve Efficiency: Enable airlines to optimize schedules and resource allocation.
 Enhance Passenger Experience: Provide timely delay predictions to minimize disruptions.
 Support Decision-Making: Assist airport management in optimizing operations.

### Features
 Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization and pattern recognition to understand the factors contributing to delays.
 Model Development: Implementation and evaluation of machine learning models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
 Performance Metrics: Use of classification reports and confusion matrices to assess model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores.

### Data Preprocessing Steps
 Handled missing data effectively using imputation.
 Encoded categorical variables (e.g., airline and airport codes) using LabelEncoder.
 Standardized numerical features to ensure balanced model performance.
 Split data into training and testing sets for robust evaluation.

### Machine Learning Models
##### The following models were trained and evaluated:

 Random Forest Classifier: Achieved an accuracy of 62% with balanced precision and recall.
 Logistic Regression: Provided a baseline accuracy of 59%.
 Gradient Boosting Classifier: Improved accuracy to 65%, highlighting the model's robustness.
 XGBoost: Achieved the highest accuracy of 67%, making it the best-performing model for this dataset.

### Key Visualizations
Delay Distribution: Shows the proportion of delayed vs. non-delayed flights.
Flight Length Analysis: Explores the relationship between flight duration and delays.
Airline-Specific Delays: Highlights airlines with higher delay frequencies.
Time of Day Analysis: Investigates how departure times correlate with delays.
